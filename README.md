# WHAT IT IS
A repo for me to store terraform configs.

# WHAT I SHOULD DO
Iunno, make separate repos for entire apps/configs and throw terraform configs and ansible playbooks where they logically belong.

# TODO (beyond WHAT I SHOULD DO)
* Break up the monolithic azure-k8s.tf file into separate files based on resource type/purpose.
