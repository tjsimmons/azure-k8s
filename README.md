# WHAT IT IS
A repo for me to store everything needed to follow the excellent [Kubernetes The Hard Way on Azure](https://github.com/ivanfioravanti/kubernetes-the-hard-way-on-azure) in an easily repeatable fashion.

# TODO
* Break up the monolithic azure-k8s.tf file into separate files based on resource type/purpose.
